## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Your AI DJ Mixer is now running! Here's how to use it:

### 1. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000

### 2. Demo Walkthrough

#### Step 1: Search for Songs
- Type song names in the two search boxes
- Example searches:
  - "Bohemian Rhapsody"
  - "Hotel California"
  - "Stairway to Heaven"
  - "Imagine"
  - "Hey Jude"

#### Step 2: Select Your Tracks
- Click on search results to select your two songs
- You'll see album art, artist name, and track details
- Both songs must be selected before mixing

#### Step 3: Generate Your Mix
- Click the "Generate Mix" button
- Watch the progress bar and loading animation
- The AI analyzes BPM, key, energy, and danceability

#### Step 4: Play Your Mix
- Use the audio player controls
- View compatibility scores and recommendations
- Toggle waveform visualization
- Adjust volume and seek through the mix

## ðŸŽ¯ Features to Try

### Search Functionality
- **Real-time search** with debouncing
- **Album art display** for visual identification
- **Track information** including duration and artist

### AI Mixing Analysis
- **Compatibility scoring** (0-100%)
- **BPM matching** for smooth transitions
- **Key compatibility** using circle of fifths
- **Energy level analysis** for flow optimization
- **Mixing recommendations** based on analysis

### Audio Player
- **Play/Pause controls** with visual feedback
- **Progress bar** with click-to-seek functionality
- **Volume control** with percentage display
- **Waveform visualization** (toggle on/off)
- **Time display** showing current position

## ðŸ”§ Technical Demo

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Search for tracks
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/search?q=bohemian"

# Get track features
curl http://localhost:5000/api/tracks/1/features

# Generate a mix
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mixes/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"song1":{"id":"1","name":"Song 1"},"song2":{"id":"2","name":"Song 2"}}'
```

### Mock Data
The application uses mock data for demonstration:
- **Search results** are filtered mock tracks
- **Audio features** are randomly generated
- **Mix generation** simulates 5-second processing
- **Waveform data** is mathematically generated

## ðŸŽµ Musical Theory Demo

### BPM Analysis
- Tracks with similar BPM get higher scores
- Large BPM differences trigger recommendations
- Smooth transitions are planned automatically

### Key Compatibility
- **Same key**: 100% compatibility
- **Adjacent keys**: 90% compatibility (circle of fifths)
- **Perfect fourth/fifth**: 80% compatibility
- **Minor third**: 60% compatibility
- **Distant keys**: 30% compatibility

### Energy Flow
- **Building energy**: Low â†’ High energy tracks
- **Maintaining energy**: Similar energy levels
- **Releasing energy**: High â†’ Low energy tracks

## ðŸš¨ Demo Limitations

### Current Implementation
- **Mock audio**: No actual audio mixing (yet)
- **Simulated processing**: 5-second generation time
- **Placeholder waveforms**: Mathematical generation
- **Limited search**: Mock track database

### Production Features (Future)
- **Real Spotify API**: Actual track search and features
- **Audio processing**: Web Audio API integration
- **AI models**: Machine learning for better mixing
- **User accounts**: Save and share mixes
- **Social features**: Community and sharing

## ðŸŽ‰ Demo Success Indicators

âœ… **Frontend loads** at http://localhost:3000  
âœ… **Search works** and shows results
